# YouTube Video Feedback

A Node.js application that evaluate YouTube videos using generative AI models to provide assessments according to the Rubric input.

## Features

- Simple web interface to input YouTube video URL and Rubric
- Uses generative AI models (OpenAI GPT or Google Gemini) for video evaluation using given rubric
- Evaluate video content against the rubric
- Provides scores for each rubric item and an overall grade
- Displays results in a clean, tabular format

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Frontend**: EJS templates with HTML/CSS
- **Generative AI Models**: 
  - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (primary model)
  - Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (alternative model)
- **Other**: Axios for HTTP requests, Dotenv for environment management

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash

   npm start
   ```
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Development

For development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. User submits a YouTube video URL and Rubric in Json format
2. The app uses a generative AI model to evaluate the video content
3. The AI generates the grades the video according to the rubric
4. Results are displayed in a table format

## Generative AI Model Configuration

The application supports both OpenAI and Google Gemini generative models:

- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is provided, it will use OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for analysis
- If `GEMINI_API_KEY` is provided, it will use Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash for analysis
- If neither is provided, it will return mock data for demonstration

## Example Usage

1. Enter a YouTube URL: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
2. Enter a rubric: `[
  {
    " - Criteria": "1. Understanding the Problem / Problem Articulation \n\nüîπ Does the student clearly understand the requirements of building a multi-page HTML-only portal? \n\nSample Questions: \n‚Ä¢ Can you tell me what your website is about? \n‚Ä¢ What pages did you create and why? \n‚Ä¢ How are your pages connected? \n‚Ä¢ Why are we using only HTML in this project?",
    "Weight (%)": 0.15,
    "Beginner (1)": "Very limited clarity: Student can name 1‚Äì2 pages but cannot explain their purpose; shows little awareness of project goal.",
    "Intermediate (2)": "Partial clarity: Student explains some pages‚Äô purpose but misses connections or the overall project objective.",
    "Advanced (3)": "Good clarity: Student explains all pages with purpose and connections; shows basic semantic awareness.",
    "Expert (4)": "Complete clarity: Student confidently explains purpose of all pages, connects project goal to HTML foundations (structure vs. styling), and justifies the ‚ÄúHTML-only‚Äù restriction."
  },
  {
    " - Criteria": "2. Robustness of the Solution ‚Äì Conceptual Clarity / Robustness / Visual Appeal \n\nüîπ Is the website structurally sound, complete, and semantically correct? \n\nSample Questions: \n‚Ä¢ Can you walk me through the tags you used on this page? \n‚Ä¢ Why did you choose <ul> vs <ol> here? \n‚Ä¢ How does your navigation work? \n‚Ä¢ Can all pages be accessed easily?\n- Can you show me how many pages you built? \n- Do your navigation links work, or do some give errors? \n- Why did you put everything inside <p> instead of using <h1>, <h2>, <ul>? \n- Does your table have headers, or is it only rows of data?\n- Why did you use <ul> for hobbies instead of <ol> on the Profile page? \n- Does your navigation menu look the same on all pages, or are some links missing? \n- Can you walk me through the form tags you used on the Feedback page? \n- Did you use <th> or <td> for your table headings‚Äîand why?\n- How did you ensure <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer> are placed consistently across all pages? \n- Why did you include <caption> in your Grades table? \n- Can you explain how <label> improves accessibility in your Feedback form? \n- If I add a new course, how would your Courses page handle it structurally?\n- Why is <thead>/<tbody>/<tfoot> important for your table even if it works without them? \n- How does your navigation ensure every page can be reached with minimal effort? \n- Why did you use <address> on the Contact page instead of just <p>? \n- If you were teaching HTML best practices, how does your site demonstrate semantic correctness? \n- How would your structure scale if more pages were added in the future?",
    "Weight (%)": 0.7,
    "Beginner (1)": "Weak structure: Pages incomplete or missing; frequent misuse of tags; navigation does not work properly.",
    "Intermediate (2)": "Basic structure: Most pages exist; some tags misused; navigation works at a basic level but lacks consistency.",
    "Advanced (3)": "Strong structure: All required pages complete; correct tags used; navigation works smoothly; shows awareness of semantic HTML.",
    "Expert (4)": "Exceptional structure: Website fully complete, robust, semantically consistent; smooth navigation; shows thoughtful structure and best practices (even without CSS/JS)."
  },
  {
    " - Criteria": "3. Solution Explanation ‚Äì Communication \n\nüîπ Does the student explain their choices in video submissions? Do they demonstrate independent understanding?\n\nSample Questions: \n‚Ä¢ Can you explain how <table> and <th> are different? \n‚Ä¢ Why did you include <label> with your form inputs? \n‚Ä¢ How does a relative link differ from an absolute link? \n‚Ä¢ If you were teaching this page to a friend, how would you explain it?",
    "Weight (%)": 0.15,
    "Beginner (1)": "Minimal explanation: Struggles to explain choices; relies on guesswork; unclear or incomplete communication.",
    "Intermediate (2)": "Basic explanation: Explains some choices but lacks depth or reasoning; communication is somewhat clear.",
    "Advanced (3)": "Clear explanation: Explains most tag choices with reasoning; demonstrates solid understanding and clear communication.",
    "Expert (4)": "Insightful explanation: Explains all choices confidently; justifies every tag with purpose; communicates with teaching-level clarity and independence."
